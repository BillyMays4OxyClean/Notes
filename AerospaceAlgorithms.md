The idea will be to create some sort of markdown language that very easily converts a set of mathmatical functions into running code that can be executed.  
This would allow the end user to type up a set of equations they want to be able to input values to, and get a result downstream to the last equation.
      - Also allowing for any conditionals as well.
      - There could be a simple index of functions at the end of the file, and a special format to reference those functions earlier in the document, allowing the user to concisely show the path each variable goes into and so fourth.
